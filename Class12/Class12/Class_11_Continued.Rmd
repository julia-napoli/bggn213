## Working with bio3d

```{r}
library(bio3d)
pdb <- read.pdb("1hel")
pdb
```
```{r}
head(pdb$atom)
```

Let's do a quick bioinformatics prediction of protein dynamics (flexibility). We use the `nma()` function, which does Normal Mode Analysis.

```{r}
modes <- nma(pdb)
plot(modes)
```

Make a trajectory of this prediction with the `mktrj()`.

```{r}
mktrj(modes, file = "nma.pdb")
```

## Comparative Structure Analysis

Start by getting a sequence of interest

```{r}
aa <- get.seq("1AKE_A")
aa
```

I want to search the PDB database (the main db for exp structures) for sequences like my aa sequence.

```{r}
blast <- blast.pdb(aa)
```

```{r}
hits <- plot(blast)
```

Now I have my top hits from the search of the PDB
```{r}
hits$pdb.id
```

Here we download all these similar structures in the PDB and store them on our computer.

```{r}
# Download related PDB files
files <- get.pdb(hits$pdb.id, path="pdbs", split=TRUE, gzip=TRUE)
```

Now we want to align all these structures. We will use the function `pdbaln()`

```{r}
# Align related PDBs
pdbs <- pdbaln(files, fit = TRUE)
```

Ldet's have a look 
```{r}
pdbs
```

```{r fig.width=10, fig.height=8} 

ids <- basename.pdb(pdbs$id)
plot(pdbs, labels =ids)
```

## Principal Component Analysis

```{r}
# Perform PCA
pc <- pca(pdbs)
plot(pc)
```

Let's visualize the displacements (i.e. movements of the structure) that are captured by PC1.

```{r}
mktrj(pc, pc = 1, file = "pca.pdb")
```

Here it issss...

Let's save our important results

```{r}
save(blast,hits,pca,pdbs,file="myresults.RData")
```
